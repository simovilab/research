# Diagnostics of the state of adoption of information and communication technologies in public transportation systems in Latin America

To:

- MobilityData
- _Centro para la Sostenibilidad Urbana_ (CPSU)
- Other potential collaborators

## Context

- Users now expect rapid digitalization in public transportation similar to what they experience in other services (e.g., Uber).
- Adoption of digital technologies is highly unequal in Latin America: while megacities (São Paulo, Mexico City, Buenos Aires, etc.) have developed their own systems, there are more than 200 cities with over 400,000 inhabitants (https://worldpopulationreview.com/cities/continent/latin-america) that could benefit from similar systems.
- Financial constraints (high initial costs, licensing) are an important barrier.
- Non-financial barriers (governance, limited digital skills, weak incentives for operators) also makes adoption difficult.
- There is limited comparative, structured evidence focused specifically on small and medium Latin American cities (gotta check this! There are studies for bigger cities, e.g., https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3366750.3366760).

## Preliminary Objectives

1. Map the current state of ICT adoption (particularly in passenger information) in public transport across a representative sample of Latin American cities with a population of more than 400k.
2. Identify principal financial and non-financial barriers for adopting ICT components.
3. Classify cities according to their level of adoption to guide tailored recommendations.
4. Produce actionable recommendations for cities, operators, and partners.

## Trigger Questions

- What are the main financial and organizational roadblocks to ICT adoption in small and medium Latin American cities?
- Which ICT components (e.g., GTFS data management, telemetry, etc.) deliver the most value?
- How do governance, regulation, technical skills, vendor pressure and other factors influence successful adoption?

## Scope

- Latin American cities (smaller than 2,000,000 in population) plus a small sample of larger cities for benchmarking.

## Methodology (initial)

- Desk research: structured online scan of public documents, open data portals, standards adoption (GTFS, etc.).
- Survey (online form) to transit agencies.
- Semi-structured virtual interviews.
- Maturity assessment (using adapted CMMI stages, see below!) to classify cities.
- Synthesis workshop (virtual) with collaborators to validate findings and refine recommendations.

## Required Resources

- Research assistants (data collection, survey administration, transcription)
- Access to partner contact networks (agencies, operators, NGOs, vendors)
- Lightweight survey and interview management tool
- Data cleaning and analysis tooling (Python + visualization dashboards)

## Stages

1. Instrument design
2. Desk research
3. Survey deployment
4. Interviews
5. Synthesis and outputs (report, article structure, dissemination assets)
6. More...

## Expected Outputs

- Academic article (English)
- Report for transit agencies and operators (Spanish & Portuguese)
- City info dataset (open, perhaps anonymized)
- Short briefs / infographics for social media
- Webinar (or series) presenting findings and recommendations

## Anticipated Benefits

- Visibility
- Actionable, prioritized recommendations
- Expanded regional network (contact list)
- Baseline for possible future pilots and funding proposals

## Possible Timeline

- Q4 2025: Strategy refinement, instrument design, pilot testing
- Q1 2026: Desk research and survey launch
- Q2 2026: Survey close, interviews, preliminary maturity analysis
- Q3 2026: Synthesis, drafting, validation
- Q4 2026: Final publications and dissemination

## Funding (to refine)

- University of Costa Rica (faculty time, student assistants)
- In-kind partner support (contacts, dissemination)
- Potential external grants (multilateral, foundations) for survey/interview execution

## Team (initial)

- Fabián Abarca-Calderón, M.Sc. (Principal Researcher)
- Fabiana Gama de Medeiros, Ph.D. (Co-Principal Researcher)
- Representatives from MobilityData
- Representatives from CPSU
- Additional collaborators (to be confirmed)

## Reference Frameworks / Inspiration

- Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI)
- Book: "Recoding America: Why Government Is Failing in the Digital Age and How We Can Do Better" (Jennifer Pahlka)
